Learning Goals:

•	Practice using inheritance to create sub-classes
•	Create UML Class Diagrams to show the Inheritance Relationship

Functional requirements:

•	Create each of the classes below in a single IntelliJ IDEA project. Name the Project Inheritance.  
•	Use GitHub to pull your Person.java file from your previous Lab.
•	Create JUnit test suite for each of your classes. (You should already have one for Person.java from the last lab.)
•	Note that there is a single java main program you will write to use all of the classes.
